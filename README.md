# Mfile VScode snippet

I created this little snippet to avoid writing again my Makefile every new project.

Just by writing mfile in an empty Makefile you will write this template, you just need to replace the comments and adjust the spaces in the box to get a fancy makefile. ðŸ™‚

Notice that bonus rule is not included, and that the libft is included. You may need to correct the path of your libft if its not in a directory name libft inside the current directory.

To add this snippet :

    1. Open VScode.
    2. Click on Manage at the bottom left of your screen.
    3. Click on User Snippets.
    4. In the search bar search for Makefile.
    5. Just copy and paste the content of Makefile.json
    6. Create a new Makefile and try to write "mfile" and press Enter.
    7. Enjoy ! ðŸ™‚

If you want to change the shortcut keyword, you juste need to modify the "prefix" line. (line 3 of the makefile.json).
